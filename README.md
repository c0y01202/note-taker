# Purpose of Project

This project required use of Express.js code and JSON packages to run and test code for a note taking application that is programmed to fetch and return data from a local server. To do this I created my own server-side APIs using the Express.js framework. Express allows the user to quickly and easily establish API routes and associated HTTP request methods. The following routes were created in Javascript files: API and and HTML routes. This activity was important because it shows how client requests work from the server side.

# External Resources Used

The following external resources were used to test and deploy applications to servers:

1. Node.js
2. Heroku
3. Jest
4. Express
5. Google Chrome developer tools
6. GitHub
7. GitBash
8. Visual Studio
9. Screencastify

# Phases of Project

To begin I created a Git repository and downloaded the starter code. From there the server.js file was updated with functions that instantiated the server. From there a basic Express.js server was created. A port was created and the code was tested in that port. The routes were tested as more files were added to the project folder. A Heroku application was created using "heroku create" in the terminal. Several applicaton errors were noted with Heroku so the code was revised many times. The routes finally worked on both servers and the function to delete notes was added at the very end and tested.

The application was uploaded to Heroku.

Code was also tested from the PORT3001 server and this worked more easily than deploying code to Heroku. Once the application was finished all files were uploaded to Heroku and GitHub. Videos demonstrating the application working on PORT3001 and Heroku can be found below.
